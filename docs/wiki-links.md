# Wiki Links

Foam enables you to Link pages together using `[[file-name]]` annotations (i.e. `[[media-wiki]]` links).

- Type `[[` and start typing a file name for autocompletion.
  - Note that your file names should be in `lower-dash-case.md`, and your wiki links should reference file names exactly: `[[lower-dash-case]]`, not `[[Lower Dash Case]]`. 
  - See [[link-formatting-and-autocompletion]] for more information, and how to setup your link autocompletions to make this easier.
- `Cmd` + `Click` ( `Ctrl` + `Click` on Windows ) on file name to navigate to file (`F12` also works while your cursor is on the file name)
- `Cmd` + `Click` ( `Ctrl` + `Click` on Windows ) on non-existent file to create that file in the workspace.

> If the `F12` shortcut feels unnatural you can rebind it at File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts by searching for `editor.action.revealDefinition`.

## Filenaming Specification

Foam is designed to be flexible to your workflow. As a result it will try to do th best thing when you link to documents.

For example:

If there was only one file in the solution called `first-file.md`, and you added the following markdown:

```markdown
Here is a link to [[another file]]
```

You now have a link to a file that doesn't exist. If you `ctrl-click` the link it wil automatically generate `another-file.md`.

Now you edit the first file more and amend the line ...

```markdown
Here is a link to [[another file]] and [[Another File]]
```
Foam decides that loosley matched files also count, so it will assume you meant `another-file.md` was the correct file to match.

However there are instances that the user may want separate versions of the same file with captialisation differences. This being a special case has to be opted in by manually creating a file `Another File.md`. Foam will know that there is a more specific version of the file, and match that instead of loosley matching.

The logic is as follows...

``` Markdown
[[New File]]
```


```mermaid
graph TD
  id1([`New File.md` exists in this directory?]) --> exit1(Use `New File.md`)
  id2([`new-file.md` exists in this directory?]) --> exit2(Use `new-file.md`)
  id3([Any file that matches `new-file.md` after being slugified in this directory?]) --> exit3(Use the unslugged file)
  id4([`New File.md` exists in the root directory?]) --> exit4(Use `New File.md` in the root)
  id5([`new-file.md` exists in the root directory?]) --> exit5(Use `new-file.md` in the root)
  id6([Any file that matches `new-file.md` after being slugified in this directory?]) --> exit6(Use the unslugged file in the root)
  exit7(Create a new file in the current directorty called `New File.md`)
  id1 --> id2 --> id3 --> id4 --> id5 --> id6 --> exit7
```

## Required extensions

 - [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) (core functionality)
 - [Foam for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode) (for Markdown compatibility)

## Markdown compatibility

The [Foam for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode) extension automatically generates [[link-reference-definitions]] at the bottom of the file to make wiki-links compatible with Markdown tools and parsers.
